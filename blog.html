    <img class="mt-4 mx-auto" src="./images/javascript-var-let-const.png" alt="">
    <p class="p-4">In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used for variable declaration, and they have different scopes and behaviors. Here's an overview of their differences:<br><br>
    

       <span class="text-pink-400">var:</span> 
        
        Function-Scoped: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are only accessible within the function in which they are declared or, if declared outside of a function, they become global variables.
        Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope, which means you can use them before they are declared in the code. However, they will be undefined until they are assigned a value.
        Reassignable: Variables declared with var can be reassigned and updated <br><br>
    
        <span class="text-pink-400">let:</span> 

        Block-Scoped: Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by {}) in which they are defined.
        Hoisting: Like var, let variables are also hoisted but not initialized. They remain in the "temporal dead zone" until they are declared.
        Reassignable: let variables can be reassigned and updated.<br><br>
    


        <span class="text-pink-400">const:</span> 

        Block-Scoped: Variables declared with const are also block-scoped.
        Constant Value: const variables cannot be reassigned once they are assigned a value. They are constant.
        Must Be Initialized: const variables must be initialized with a value when declared.
    
    
    </p>
    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center mt-4">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
    <p class="p-4">null and undefined are both values in JavaScript that represent the absence of meaningful data, but they are used in slightly different contexts:

        <br><br>
    

        <span class="text-pink-400">null:</span> 
         
        Explicit Assignment: Developers typically assign null to variables or properties when they want to indicate that the value should be intentionally empty or non-existent.
        Intentional Absence: It's often used to represent an intentional lack of an object or value where something is expected to be present. <br><br>
     
         <span class="text-pink-400">undefined:</span> 
 
        Implicit Absence: undefined is the default value of variables and properties that have been declared but have not been assigned any value.
        Function Return: Functions that do not explicitly return a value return undefined.<br><br>

     <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl text-center mt-4">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
     <p class="p-4">REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services using the REST principles. Here's a breakdown of what REST and RESTful APIs entail:

        Resources: In REST, everything is treated as a resource. These resources can be physical entities (e.g., objects, documents) or abstract concepts (e.g., user accounts, orders). Resources are identified by unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), such as URLs.
        
        HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:
        
        GET: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., fetching a resource).
        POST: Create a new resource on the server (e.g., adding a new item to a collection).
        PUT: Update an existing resource on the server (e.g., replacing an item in a collection).
        DELETE: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., deleting an item).
        PATCH: Partially update a resource (e.g., updating only specific fields of an item).
        Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state between requests. This makes REST APIs highly scalable and easy to cache.
        
        Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text. Clients can specify the desired representation in the request, and the server responds with the requested data format.
        
        Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface. This simplifies client-server interactions because developers can follow predictable patterns when working with different APIs.
        
        Layered System: REST allows for a layered architecture, where a client may interact with an API through an intermediary, like a load balancer or cache. Each layer performs a specific function and is unaware of the details of other layers.
        
        Client-Server: REST enforces a separation between the client and the server, allowing them to evolve independently. This separation promotes scalability, as clients and servers can be developed and upgraded separately.
        
        RESTful APIs are widely used in web development for creating web services that can be consumed by various clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers. They provide a standard way to interact with resources over the internet, making it easier to build and integrate software components in a distributed and scalable manner.
